	a) Padding affects the box width height, etc. (in px)
	b) margin affects the area around the box like space between boxes in px
3.
	a) the larger margin the smaller the background color (overlaps) and at 100 pixels it completely overwrites the text background color
	b) the padding makes a really cool square box like thing that increases the background color of the text and will scale well over 100px and draw outside of the box but behind the other boxes
4.
	a)Scroll adds scroll bars to view the whole padding
	b)hidden cuts off any overflow out of the box
5.
	a)float left didnt change much because they were already on the right side :( from 1 to 3 in one line
